## Introduction

GuanceCloud Application Monitoring can collect metric data from various Android applications and analyze the performance of each Android app client in a visualized way.

## Example

 [GuanceCloud SDK Android Demo](https://github.com/GuanceDemo/guance-app-demo/tree/master/src/android/demo)   

## Documentation
 [Documentation Center](https://docs.guance.com/real-user-monitoring/android/app-access/)   

### Cold-start Action launch type

Automatic cold-start Actions report `app_launch_type` for the observed startup interval,
from the initial Application startup hook through completion of the first-draw measurement:

| Value | Startup states |
| --- | --- |
| `foreground` | Foreground only |
| `background` | Background only |
| `foreground_and_background` | Both foreground and background, in either order |

The original total duration is retained. Transitions after cold-start completion do not
change the recorded type, including when SDK initialization delays reporting. Hot-start
Actions do not include this field.
